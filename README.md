Can start the application with python app.py

Make sure have python 3 and have installed the requirements.txt



Next steps:

	Requirements.txt may have too many libraries. I will figure out the minimum needed for this project and update the requirements.txt

    Row 2 and Row 3 panels look fine (white space spans entire background on Safari and Mozilla. On Chrome it does not work though. . . ). Need to make the dashboard render properly on all web browsers. 

	I need to figure out what device sizes that this project is for, so then I can edit the xs, md, and lg sizes for rendering. 

	I need to figure out where I am collecting data from. 

	I need to generate artificial data to display donut pie chart, barchart, and table for data access points. 

	Need to restructure what is on screen whenever a panel x is clicked on. 

	Need to construct a response and action when the down arrow is pressed for a panel

	Think of a way to display all panels. (Useful when a user has closed many panels, but would like to now see them all)
